# Wav Splitter
This is a program to split one big wav file into multiple smaller wav files. It was originally made in mind for the converted audio files to be used for entries in N64 sound banks for N64 homebrew development. More specifically music - by stringing each wav together to give the illusion of music.

There is another program I have been writing called the "N64 Modern Sound Bank Compiler". But, due to a lack of existing documentation and source files, I have been unable to continue. Everything else has been found simply by hex editing the files. Unless such future discoveries are made, that program may not be touched again.

Other than for N64 homebrew development, I'm not sure what this program can be used for. It could probably be used for the PS1 in the same manner. But, rather than for sound banks, as vag files - which is what the PS1 uses. Perhaps one could use it to randomize music in their games. When it comes to ideas on this one, there really aren't too many I can think of.

Anyways, this has only been written, compiled, and tested on Windows 10 with Dev-C++ version 5.11. If you plan to port it to other operating systems in other languages, please do - just be sure to let me know. I don't know much about licensing, but all permission to port is welcome.
